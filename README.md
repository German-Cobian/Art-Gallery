# Art-Gallery

This React-Redux app fetches artworks from the [Art Institute of Chicago API] (https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks).

From the home page the user can input a term related to the artwork that they are searching for (could be the name of the artwork, the srtist, the syle, etc.):

![AIC Home](/src/assets/Screenshot1.png?raw=true "AIC Home")

The app will then render a listing of all the artworks that match the search criteria, displaying their image as well as their title and creator data. 

![Search results](/src/assets/Screenshot2.png?raw=true "Search results")

It also allows for the user to select a specific artwork by clicking on it and to display more information on it ( date, type of artwork, dimensions, medium, provenance of artist, category in which the artwork is included).

![Artwork in detail](/src/assets/Screenshot3.png?raw=true "Artwork in detail")
